# Canonical Order of Operations Index Laws

### I. **Implicit Power of 1 for Any Number or Variable**
$a = a^1$

Every number or variable is always implicitly raised to the power of 1, even if not explicitly written. This foundational rule enables consistent application of exponent laws, establishing each base as $a^1$.

---

### II. **Multiplying Powers with the Same Base**
$a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$

When multiplying expressions with the same base, add the exponents. This rule consolidates powers correctly: $a^2 \times a^3 = a^{2+3} = a^5$.

---

### III. **Dividing Powers with the Same Base**
$\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n} \quad \text{(where } a \neq 0)$

When dividing expressions with the same base, subtract the exponent of the denominator from that of the numerator. This ensures accurate reduction: $\frac{a^5}{a^2} = a^{5-2} = a^3$.

---

### IV. **Power of a Power**
$(a^m)^n = a^{m \times n} = a^{mn}$

When an exponentiated expression is raised to another power, multiply the exponents. Following the order of operations, parentheses must be removed first, achieved here by applying this rule: $(a^2)^3 = a^{2 \times 3} = a^6$.

---

### V. **Parenthesized Base Raised to a Power**
$(a)^m = (a^1)^m = a^{1 \times m} = a^m$

For a variable or number in parentheses, recognize the base as implicitly raised to the power of 1. According to standard arithmetic rules, each number or variable is treated as $a^1$, which enables removal of parentheses and application of the power: $(a)^m = (a^1)^m = a^{1 \times m} = a^m$.

---

### VI. **Zero Exponent Law**
$a^0 = 1 \quad \text{(where } a \neq 0)$

Any non-zero number raised to the power of zero is always equal to 1. This universal law applies to all bases: $5^0 = 1$.

---

### VII. **Negative Exponent Law**
$a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m} \quad \text{(where } a \neq 0)$

A negative exponent inverts the base, resulting in the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent: $a^{-2} = \frac{1}{a^2}$.

---

### VIII. **Distributing a Power over Multiplication**
$(ab)^m = a^m \times b^m$

When a product is raised to a power, distribute the exponent to each factor within the parentheses. This step is necessary for accurate results: $(2x)^3 = 2^3 \times x^3 = 8x^3$.

---

### IX. **Distributing a Power over Division**
$\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^m = \frac{a^m}{b^m} \quad \text{(where } b \neq 0)$

When a fraction is raised to a power, distribute the exponent to both numerator and denominator. This ensures proper handling of fractional powers: $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2^2}{3^2} = \frac{4}{9}$.

---

### X. **Power as the Inverse (Root Interpretation)**
$a^{\frac{1}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a}$

Raising a number to the power of $\frac{1}{n}$ equates to taking the nth root of that number: $a^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{a}$.

---

### XI. **Fractional Exponents Representing Power and Root**
$a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}$
A fractional exponent implies both a power and a root, with the denominator as the root and the numerator as the power. This interpretation is essential: $a^{\frac{3}{2}} = \sqrt{a^3}$.

---

### XII. **Power of 1**
$a^1 = a$

Any number raised to the power of 1 remains unchanged. This rule is absolute: $7^1 = 7$.

---

### XIII. **Zero to a Positive Exponent**
$0^m = 0 \quad \text{(for } m > 0)$

Zero raised to any positive exponent is always zero, without exception: $0^5 = 0$.

---

### XIV. **Interpreting Negative Signs with Powers**
For expressions with negative bases raised to powers, the negative sign remains external when the base is implicitly raised to the power of 1. Applying the implicit unity concept allows consistent handling of negatives:

$(-a)^m = (-a^1)^m = -a^{1 \times m} = -a^m$

This interpretation maintains the negative outside the exponentiated term, ensuring proper evaluation.

---

### **The Law of Implicit Unity in Exponential Powers**
This law establishes that every base, whether explicitly stated or in parentheses, is implicitly raised to the power of 1, enabling the removal of parentheses without altering the expression. It reinforces that parentheses containing bases should be viewed as $a^1$, ensuring consistent exponentiation:

1. For any term in parentheses, the base can be considered raised to the implicit power of 1.
   
   $(a)^m = (a^1)^m = a^{1 \times m} = a^m$

2. In cases involving negatives, such as $(-a)^m$, apply this implicit unity to the absolute base:
   
   $(-a)^m = (-a^1)^m = -a^{1 \times m} = -a^m$
