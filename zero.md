| 1  | Division Law of Small Fractions   | $\frac{x}{y}$                               | Measures how many times $y$ "fits into" $x$, emphasizing comparative division.               |
| 2  | Instantaneous Velocity Law        | $\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{d}{t} = \infty$       | As time approaches zero, speed theoretically approaches infinity, modeling ideal instantaneous velocity. |
| 3  | Division by Zero (General Form)   | $\frac{x}{0} = \infty$                      | Any finite number divided by zero suggests infinity, implying endless "zeros" fit into it.   |
| 4  | Zero Multiplier Law               | $x \cdot 0 = 0$                             | Any number times zero equals zero, in line with traditional arithmetic.                      |
| 5  | Zero Dividend Law                 | $\frac{0}{x} = 0 \quad \text{for } x \neq 0$| Zero divided by any non-zero number is zero, following standard division.                    |
| 6  | Self-Division Law                 | $\frac{x}{x} = 1$                           | Any non-zero number divided by itself is one, reflecting proportional division.              |
| 7  | Ambiguous Zero Division Law       | $\frac{0}{0} = 1$ or $\frac{0}{0} = \infty$ | Division of zero by zero can be one (self-fit) or infinite, acknowledging inherent ambiguity.|
| 8  | Reciprocal of Infinity Law        | $\frac{1}{\infty} = 0$                      | Dividing by infinity approaches zero, implying infinitesimal values.                         |
| 9  | Proportionality of Infinity       | $\frac{\infty}{\infty} = 1$                 | Infinity divided by itself as one, suggesting proportional self-similarity.                  |
| 10 | Zero and Infinity Product Hypothesis | $0 \cdot \infty = 1$                      | Hypothetically, combining zero and infinity yields unity, implying a balanced relationship between extremes. |
